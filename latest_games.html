					<article>2018 has already been a great year for games, and it's showing no signs of letting up, with even more good stuff on the way in 2019. The likes of Spider-Man and God of War have already blown us away over the last few months, and we've still got Fallout 76, Battlefield V, and Red Dead Redemption 2 on the way this year - to name just a few.</article>

					<article>It's exhausting trying to keep up with all the new releases on the way, so we've decided to do the hard work for you and round up all of the biggest and best games on the way this year, next year, and even a few that might be further off than that. We've done our best to include games from across all the main consoles and PC, listed in release date order.

						<article>After being anticipated for some time and rumored to be a launch title for the Switch, a remastered edition of Dark Souls is finally happening. The remaster gives us all the Dark Souls content we love but now on modern consoles and with the Artorias of the Abyss DLC included as well as updated resolutions and framerates.

						<h2>Dragon Quest XI: Echoes of an Elusive Age</h2>
						<img src="assets/images/darksoul.jpg.jpg" class="center" height="500" style="width: 80%;">
						<article>Dragon Quest XI: Echoes of an Elusive Age is the long awaited 11th entry in the beloved series. Players play as a hero believed to be a harbinger of darkness and is hunted down as such. But with an eclectic cast of characters, they’ll learn of the ominous threat facing the world.</article>

						<article>The game will retain the open world and enemy encounters of Dragon Quest IX, with players finding monsters exploring the world instead of encountering them randomly. The game will also use the dynamic camera system seen in Dragon Quest IX for combat along with a new camera system controlled by the player according to a recent trailer. Other than that, it looks to be the same Dragon Quest formula we know and love. And according to the official website, the game will keep us playing well over 100 hours with side quest and mini-games.
